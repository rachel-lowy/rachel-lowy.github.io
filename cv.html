            <h2>Research Interests</h2>
            <p>
                My research focuses on designing accessible and inclusive technologies that enhance learning, work, and social experiences for neurodivergent individuals. By employing a co-design approach, I strive to ensure that my design contributions resonate with the unique perspectives of neurodivergent communities, aligning closely with their interests and priorities.
