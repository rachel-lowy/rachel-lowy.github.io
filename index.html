        <!-- Bio Section -->
        <div class="bio">
            <p>
                I am a PhD student in <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/degree-programs/phd-human-centered-computing">Human-Centered Computing</a> at Georgia Tech, where I am advised by <a href="https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~jkim693/">Jennifer Kim</a>. 
                
                My research explores how technology can foster meaningful learning and communication between people with different cognitive profiles. I focus on co-designing in partnership with users to ensure that the process of design  technology reflects their lived experiences. I am especially excited about bringing co-design into educational spaces, where we can collaboratively build knowledge and instill learners with a sense of agency in a rapidly evolving technology landscape. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Before beginning my PhD, I spent a decade as a speech therapist in private clinics, public schools, and on research intervention teams. Working as part of teams from the <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/uwautism/">University of Washington Autism Center</a> and <a href="http://ilabs.washington.edu//">Institute for Learning & Brain Sciences (I-LABS)</a> fueled my interest in research and working with a wide spectrum of learners. Seeing the impact of well-designed educational and accessibility tools firsthand continues to drive my research today.

        <!-- Research Interests -->
        <div class="research">
            <h2>Research Interests</h2>
            <p>
            My research centers on designing <strong>educational technology</strong> that empowers learners by promoting agency and enabling personalized learning pathways, particularly for students with diverse cognitive profiles, including those with disabilities. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I use <strong>participatory and co-design methodologies</strong> to develop tools that align with the priorities of users, ensuring that designs reflect their lived experiences. A key focus of my work is exploring how <strong>AI can foster collaboration</strong> and strengthen connections between teachers, learners, and peers to create learning environments that foster meaningful growth.
